Contains everything I want to do, want to learn, want to build, want to become, want to see, want to listen.

## What’s this?

Hey! Welcome to my random corner of GitHub.  
This repo is basically my playground (and dumping ground) for anything I find cool, want to try out, learn, build, or just keep track of. Expect lots of unfinished experiments, scribbles, notes, big dreams, and some fun stuff.

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Project ideas** – Some might work, some... probably not.  
- **Learning notes** – Stuff I’m picking up along the way.
- **Bucket list things** – Places, books, music, wild plans, who knows!
- **Links & resources** – Good things I don’t want to forget.
- **Random thoughts** – Because why not?

## How to use this

Browse around,
- [learning.md](https://github.com/pavankumarbalijepalli/literally-everything/blob/main/learning.md) is the file which has everything I wanted to learn. I will add new stuff but don't worry, I will append to the end.
- [podcasts.md](https://github.com/pavankumarbalijepalli/literally-everything/blob/main/podcasts.md) is the file which has all kinds of content I wanted to listen to. It could be podcasts on life, god, philosophy, or science.
- [habits.md](https://github.com/pavankumarbalijepalli/literally-everything/blob/main/habits.md) is the file which will have the habits I want to develop or I currently have. Potentially be a list of things I tried and failed at.
