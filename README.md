## What’s this?

Hey! Welcome to my random corner of GitHub.  
This repo is basically my playground (and dumping ground) for anything I find cool, want to try out, learn, build, or just keep track of. Expect lots of unfinished experiments, scribbles, notes, big dreams, and some fun stuff.

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Project ideas** – Some might work, some... probably not.  
- **Learning notes** – Stuff I’m picking up along the way.
- **Bucket list things** – Places, books, music, wild plans, who knows!
- **Links & resources** – Good things I don’t want to forget.
- **Random thoughts** – Because why not?
